### Hi I'm AI Robot Engineer ðŸ‘‹

I'm working on autonomous systems, focusing on **visual AI**, **path planning**, and **Physics-Informed hybrid AI** that integrates **rule-based** and **learning-based** Approaches (including **Imitation Learning** and **Reinforcement Learning**).

Letâ€™s push the limits of what robots can do! ðŸš€

I'm working on autonomous systems, focusing on **visual localization**, **path planning**, and **hybrid AI** (combining **rule-based** and **learning-based** methods).


## ðŸ”­ Current Work:
- Developing **hybrid AI architectures** for **autonomous navigation** using **Nav2**, **GLIM**, **RL**, and **IL**.
- Improving **visual localization** and **dynamic obstacle avoidance** in complex environments.

## ðŸŒ± What Iâ€™m Learning:
- Enhancing my skills in **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and **Imitation Learning (IL)** for optimized navigation.

## ðŸ‘¯ Letâ€™s Collaborate:
- Open to projects in **autonomous driving**, **AI in robotics**, and **hybrid AI integration**.
